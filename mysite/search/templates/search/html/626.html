It is designed for students who wish to graduate with a double-major <br>degree, i.e., when enrolling in this program in Computer Science, students are also required to declare study in another major. They are then <br>required to complete the requirements of both majors, and will receive a degree with two program designations upon graduation.<br><p></p><br><p></p><br>Students who join the program are carefully supervised in order to build and follow a study plan tailored to their specific interests and needs, and <br>serve as a strong platform to achieve their future career goals. Many alumni subsequently joined top graduate level programs worldwide (see alumni stories <br>at the end of the video).<br><p></p><br><a name="Admission"></a><br><h1>Admission</h1><br><h3>Eligibility</h3><br><p><br>Admission to the COSC double-major program requires the permission of both the CSE department and the 2nd department. We currently expect a <i>CGA of A- or higher</i> <br>at the time of the application and the existence of a workable double-major study plan that allows the student to finish within the standard 4 years.<br></p><br><p><br>In very special cases we will accept students who have a slightly lower average but <br>have shown exceptional performance in their major courses.<br></p><br><h3>"Trying out" the program</h3><br><p>Students who are interested in the possibility of declaring a COSC double-major, should try to develop a tentative study plan to better assess the feasibility <br>of completing the program.<p></p><br><p><br>This process can be done even before the student declares or is assigned a department during the first year. <br>Please see this <a href="bsc4y.pdf"><b>Study Plan Sheet</b></a> for detailed requirements.<br></p><br><h3>Officially joining the program</h3><br><p><br>Students who have already registered in the BEng in Computer Science (or other undergraduate programs) and wish to study the BSc in Computer Science as <br>their first major must apply for transfer into this program. They are required to declare study in another BSc program (second major) at the same time. <br>Transfer applications should be submitted no earlier than the first regular term<br>of their second year of study and at the latest before the end of the <br>add/drop period in the first regular term of their final year of study. Note that this transfer can only be officially completed after the student is <br>assigned a department. However, the student can discuss their study plan with the coordinator in advance of declaring a department to ensure that they will <br>be able to join the COSC double-major.<br></p><br><p><br><p>Declaration procedure for COMP BEng students: Fill in two forms at the same time: (1) the <!--a href="r-6.pdf"--><br><a href="http://arr.ust.hk/reg/forms/r-6.pdf"><b>Application for Program Transfer</b></a> form to transfer from BEng program (e.g., COMP/CSIE/CPEG) to <br>BSc program (COSC), (2) the <!--a href="r-47.pdf"--><br><a href="http://arr.ust.hk/reg/forms/r-47.pdf"><b>Declaration of Additional Undergraduate Major Program</b></a> form to declare a dual program designation (e.g., MATH). <br>Please note that MATH requires students to declare which major option (e.g., Applied Math, Pure Math) they wish to pursue at the time of declaring MATH as the second major.<br>The forms can be submitted to COSC coordinator (via the CSE General Office) any time during a semester, however the transfer <br>will only be effective at the beginning of the following semester.<br></p><br><p><br>Students who wish to study the BSc in Computer Science as their second major should follow the declaration procedures set by their (first) major <br>department.<br></p><br><h3>Leaving the program</h3><br><p>Students who wish to discontinue study in the BSc in Computer Science as their first major may apply for transferring to the BEng program in <br>Computer Science or other program. Application for the former must be submitted to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering no later than the last day <br>of the add/drop period in the first semester of their final year of study. Application for the latter will be considered and approved by the program <br>department concerned.</p><br><a name="Study"></a><br><h1>Study Plan</h1><br><h3>Important Resources</h3><br><p>This section provides information on preparing a study plan and filling out a Study Plan Sheet that meets the requirements of the COSC degree.<br><br><p>Current detailed information on program requirements on all majors for first year students can be found in the <a href="https://prog-crs.ust.hk/ug"><b>Program Catalog</b></a>. For students admitted in earlier years, this information is in the<br><a href="http://ugadmin.ust.hk/curriculum_hb/"><b>Curriculum <br>Handbook</b></a>. Direct links to the COSC program information is provided on the menu bar to the left.</p><br><p>Note that students also need to fulfill the requirements of the second major. Make sure to also check these requirements in the program catalog or <br>curriculum handbook.</p><br><p>Refer to the external shortcuts on the left sidebar at the top of the page for direct links to other useful resources, such as course listings.</p><br><!--<br><h3><br>Additional reference study patterns prepared for students who entered before 2010<br></h3><br><br>  <ul> <br>  <li><a href="plans/CS_MATH.pdf">General Mathematics Option</a></li> <br>  <li><a href="plans/CS_Hon_MATH_GM.pdf">General Mathematics Option with COMP honors track</a></li> <br>  <li><a href="plans/CS_Hon_MATH_PM.pdf">Pure Mathematics Option with COMP honors track</a></li> <br>  <li><a href="plans/CS_Hon_MATH_AM.pdf">Applied Mathematics Option with COMP honors track</a></li> <br> </ul> <br>--><br><h3>School, University, and Language requirements</h3><br><p>School course requirements only need to be fulfilled for the <i>first major</i>. School requirements for the additional majors do not need to be fulfilled unless <br>they are a prerequisite to a required course of one of the majors.</p><br><p>University course requirements are common and can double-count for both majors.</p><br><p>Students only need to fulfill language requirements of one major. They need to officially request a substituation for the other major\'s language requirement at the <br>general office of the other major. Usually students are expected to follow the language requirements of the first major, however there are situations where it may be <br>suitable to take language courses from the other major. For example, the language course in the final year of the COSC major is tied with the FYP project. So, if a <br>student is not doing an FYP project, it would make sense to take the language course of the other major even if COSC is their first major.</p><br><h3>Notes for students interested in going out on exchange</h3><br><p>HKUST students are highly encoraged to go on exchange. The international exposure gained enhances students\' educational experience, boosts <br>personal development, and helps provide a competitive advantage in future career development.</p><br><p><br>The majority of our COSC students do exchange out for a <br>semester. <br>Doing an exchange is possible, though care must be taken<br>to develop a study plan to accommodate, taking courses that can be transfered to HKUST to fill degree requirements.<br></p><br><h3>Notes for students interested in doing research</h3><br><p><br>Students interested in doing research are encouraged to approach a faculty member with similar research interests and discuss the possibility of <br>working on a UROP project. UROP stands for Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and is one of HKUST\'s signature programs designed to <br>provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in academic research and help them develop a broad and insightful perspective of <br>their areas of interest. For additional information on this program refer to the <a href="https://urop.ust.hk/">UROP project page</a>.<br></p><br><p><br>As with the exchange program, care must be taken not to overload oneself with too many courses and research tasks in the same term.<br></p><br><a name="Faq"></a><br><h1>FAQ</h1><br><ol><br><li><strong>What are the major differences between the BEng (COMP) degree <br>and the BSc (COSC) degree?</strong><br><p>The BSc degree retains all of the core COMP BEng requirements. The <br>major differences are that Final Year project and industrial training requirements<br>have been removed and the choice of required COMP courses is more flexible. <br>This allows strong students to have the flexiblity to take more advanced <br>courses, get a double-major with other fields, and have more time for UROP or<br>other research opportunities.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>What other majors can be taken as a second major with <br>COSC?</strong><br><p>Any other major with the exception of COMP and CPEG could, <br>theoretically, be taken as a second major with COSC.</p><br><p>In practice, scheduling constraints make some 2nd major pairings <br>impossible. Known workable pairings are <strong>COSC/MATH</strong> (for <br>all MATH programs), <strong>COSC/PHYSICS</strong>, <br><strong>COSC/MAEC</strong> and <strong>COSC/RMBI</strong>.</p><br><p>This does not mean that other pairings are impossible. In fact, the <br>COSC double-major was originally only designed with the MATH pairing in mind. <br>Later combinations were added when interested students came to the CSE <br>department and asked if it was possible to set up a study plan allowing <br>other possibilities. If you are interested in a pairing that is not listed <br>above, please contact the COSC coordinator.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>I don\'t know now if I want to double-major but do want to keep <br>my options open for declaring later. What should I do?</strong><br><p>The first thing you should do is take the courses that would be <br>necessary for double-major students. For COSC, that requires taking COMP 1021/2 as early as possible. <br>For MATH, that would require taking MATH 2021 or MATH 2023.</p><br><p>If you are all interested in the possibility of declaring a double-major later, it is best for you to talk with the COSC coordinator as <br>early as possible in order to develop a reasonable study <br>plan.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>How long will it take a student to get a double-major?</strong><br><p>Usually the same duration as a standard program, though overloading will<br>be required as there is an increase in number of required credits.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>Can courses double-count towards requirements of both COSC<br>and MATH?</strong><br><p>Yes. Some MATH courses, such as MATH 2121 and MATH 2421, are required by <br>the COSC degree. Thus these courses count towards fulfilling <br>requirements of both majors.</p><br><p>In addition, the COSC 4-yr program requires taking 6 COMP electives. Of these, <br>with prior approval of the COMP UG Coordinator, up to 3 can be satisfied <br>by taking computer science related courses in a non-COMP department.  <br>Some courses for which such approval has already been granted are:</p><br><ul><br><li>MATH 3343:\tCombinatorial Analysis (not regularly offered)</li><br><li>MATH 4321:\tGame Theory (offered in Spring)</li><br><li>MATH 4141:\tNumber Theory and Applications (offered in Fall)</li><br><li>MATH 3312:\tNumerical Analysis (offered in Fall)</li><br><li>ELEC 2420:\tBasic Electronics (offered in Fall)</li><br></ul><br><p>Notice that the above list is not exhaustive; other non-CSE courses <br>may also considered upon the approval of the UG director.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>What are possible course substitutions?</strong><br><p>Various course substitutions may be allowed by different departments. <br>For example, <!--MATH 2023 can be replaced by MATH 2021, MATH 2033 by MATH 2031, --><br>MATH 3033 can be replaced by MATH 3043, MATH 2721 by MATH 2421 or any MATH 3xxx course.</p><br><p>The general principle is that any substitutions allowed by the <br>department XXXX for their normal BSc programs are allowed for the double-major COSC-XXXX program. Please seek approval from the XXXX UG coordinator <br>concerning any substitutions of XXXX courses.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>What will be the degree awarded for double-major <br>COSC-MATH?</strong><br><p>Only one degree will be awarded. For example, for students doing <br>COSC+MATH:</p><br><ul><br><li>students whose 1st declared major was COSC will get a <strong>BSc <br>in Computer Science &amp; Mathematics</strong>.</li><br><li>students whose 1st declared major was MATH will get a <strong>BSc <br>in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science</strong>.</li><br></ul><br></li><br><li><strong>How are study patterns and course registration handled?</strong><br><p>Once enrolled in the double-major, ARR will pre-register all required <br>courses according to the study pattern of COSC-MATH that appears <br>in the Academic Calendar. <strong>This means that only the COSC+MATH <br>study pattern is sure to have no time table clashes.</strong></p><br><p>You should note, though, note that many double-major students, even <br>COSC+MATH ones, do not follow the normal study pattern (e.g., because <br>they want to go on exchange). In this case, there might also be time <br>clashes.</p><br><p>In order to minimize the number of clashes the CSE department does <br>provide some help with registration. In particular, our office staff will <br>contact all registered BSc students prior to semester registration and ask <br>for a list of all required courses (in both majors) that they need to take <br>that semester. We then inform ARR so that are aware of your scheduling <br>issues. This does not guarantee lack of scheduling conflicts but does help <br>minimize them.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>Do COSC students have to take the FYP<!--(COMP <br>4983/4984)-->?</strong><br><p>No. Double-major students do not have to register for the final year <br>project course. They may do a final year project or final year thesis if <br>they want to, though. In those cases, the FYP/FYT will count as two COMP <br>electives.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>Do COSC students have to register for Industrial <br><!--Training (COMP 2999)-->Experience?</strong><br><p>No. If a COSC student, does want to take an <br>industrial training module, he/she will need to ask for special permission <br>to register. If you are interested in pursuing this, please ask the COSC <br>coordinator for more information.</p><br></li><br><li><strong>Can COSC students still minor in other <br>programs?</strong><br><p>Technically, yes, but this would be difficult and probably require a <br>lot of overloading.</p><br></li><br></ol><br><a name="Contact"></a><br><h1>Contact</h1><br><p><br>Coordinator: Prof. Mordecai Golin<br/><br>Email: golin \'the at symbol\' cse.ust.hk<br></p><br><p><br>Mailing address:<br/><br>Department of Computer Science and Engineering<br/><br>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology<br/><br>Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br/><br>(no zip code)</p><br><p><br>Office:<br/><br>Academic Building, Room 3559<br/><br>(accessible through lifts 25-26)<p><br></p><br></p></p></p></p></div><br><!-- wrap ends here --><br></div><br><!-- footer starts here --><br><div class="footer"><br><p>\t<br>\t\t 2011 <strong>HKUST CSE</strong> \t <br>\t\tBased on design by: <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">styleshout</a><br>\t\t<br>\t\t<a href="index.html">Home</a><br></p><br></div><br></body><br></html><br>'
