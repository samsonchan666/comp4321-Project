id="session1">Session 1 (2:00-2:40pm)</h2><br><p>Introduction by cybersecurity lab researchers by <strong>Prof. Cunsheng <br>DING</strong>, CSE Department, <strong>Dr. Tao WANG</strong>, CSE <br>Department and <strong>Dr. Nicole FERN</strong>, ECE Department.</p><br><p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Dr. Charles ZHANG, Director of Cybersecurity <br>Lab, Associate Professor, CSE Department</p><br><h3>Title 1 (2:10-2:20pm):<br/><br>Introduction to Hardware Security <br></h3><br><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Nicole FERN, Visting Scholar, ECE <br>Department</p><br><h4>Abstract</h4><br><p>Properties of hardware can allow an attacker to compromise system <br>security, but at the same time hardware can provide a root of trust for <br>security at the software level.  This talk will examine both of these <br>aspects and provide an overview of the hardware security field.</p><br><h4>Biography</h4><br><p>Nicole Fern received her undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering <br>from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and her PhD <br>degree in the ECE department at UC Santa Barbara under the advisement of <br>Professor Tim Cheng.  She is now a post-doc at UC Santa Barbara and a <br>Visiting Scholar at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Her <br>research interests include hardware verification and security.</p><br><h3>Title 2 (2:20-2:30pm):<br/><br>Walkie-Talkie: An Efficient and Effective Website Fingerprinting <br>Defense</h3><br><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Tao WANG, Assistant Professor, CSE <br>Department</p><br><h4>Abstract</h4><br><p>Website fingerprinting (WF) is a traffic analysis attack that allows an <br>eavesdropper to determine the web activity of a client, even if the client <br>is using privacy technologies such as proxies, VPNs, or Tor.  Recent work <br>has highlighted the threat of website fingerprinting to privacy-sensitive <br>web users.  Many previously designed defenses against website <br>fingerprinting have been broken by newer attacks that use better <br>classifiers.  In this talk we will discuss Walkie-Talkie, an effective and <br>efficient website fingerprinting defense that cannot be defeated by any <br>website fingerprinting attack.  Walkie-Talkie modifies the browser to <br>communicate in half-duplex mode rather than the usual full-duplex mode.</p><br><h4>Biography</h4><br><p>Tao Wang joined the Cybersecurity Lab at HKUST as an Assistant Professor <br>in 2016. His research is in security and privacy, with a special focus on <br>web privacy and anonymity networks. Tao Wang received his Ph.D. at the <br>University of Waterloo, having been awarded the Ontario Graduate <br>Scholarship for his research.</p><br><h3>Title 3 (2:30-2:40pm):<br/><br>My Past and Current Research</h3><br><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Prof. Cunsheng DING, Professor, CSE <br>Department</p><br><h4>Abstract</h4><br><p>In this talk, I will introduce my past and current research interests <br>briefly.</p><br><h4>Biography</h4><br><p>Cunsheng Ding was educated at Shaanxi Normal University (China), The <br>Northwestern Telecommunications Engineering Institute (China), The <br>Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), and The University of Turku <br>(Finland). His education has a background in physics, computer science and <br>mathematics.</p><br><p>Prof. Ding was a lecturer of mathematics for four years at Xidian <br>University, China; and an assistant professor of computer science for <br>three years at The National University of Singapore, Singapore. Since 2000 <br>he has been with the Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong <br>University of Science and Technology.</p><br><h2 id="session2">Session 2 (2:40-4:10pm)</h2><br><p>Industrial talks, 20 mins each including Q&amp;A.</p><br><h3>Title 1 (2:40-3:10pm):<br/><br>Introduction to the HKUST Firebird CTF team, Capture The Flag (CTF) Game, <br>Cyber Security and Research</h3><br><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Mr. Anthony LAI (VXRL, Affiliated Member), Mr. <br>Ping Fan KE (a.k.a. Zetta) (VXRL, Affiliated Member), Mr. Alan HO <br>(Knownsec)</p><br><h4>Abstract</h4><br><p>Other than learning from textbook about security or reading one\'s paper, <br>we advance our skills via joining Capture The Flag games. There are <br>numerous prominent CTF teams in this planet and we have played CTF since <br>2010.</p><br><p>In this talk, we will brief about CTF, how the game could be beneficial <br>to the development of skills, cybersecurity and research area as well as <br>impact on the world. We may walk through simple challenges so that you <br>could realize the importance and fun behind.</p><br><h4>Biography</h4><br><p>Anthony is with hybrid experience in application development, code <br>security, penetration test and threat analysis areas for 13 years. He has <br>done vulnerability assessment, penetration, IT audit and training for <br>government and various corporates. He is now a lead consultant and guest <br>threat advisory of several MNCs. He is currently a part time PhD student <br>supervised by Dr. Jogesh Muppala, focus on threat and malware analysis and <br>attack profiling. Anthony published research in Blackhat USA, DEFCON as <br>well as Hack-In-Taiwan and has set up a security research group called VXRL <br>(<a href="http://www.vxrl.org/">www.vxrl.org</a>). He is the chairman of OWASP (HK <br>Chapter) and is the mentor of SANS course including GREM and GXPN holder. <br>He is passionate over Capture The Flag (CTF) games since 2011.</p><br><p>Zetta is a security researcher of Valkyrie-X Security Research Group <br>(VXRL), a non-profit organization for information security research in Hong <br>Kong. He has experience in web application security and cryptography. He <br>also actively participates in worldwide Capture the Flag (CTF) game. He is <br>currently a PhD student in the Department of ISOM at HKUST, and his <br>research focus is on economics of security.</p><br><p>Alan Ho is passionate over Web hacking, Application security and various <br>research. He is now working as a Web Application Security consultant. He <br>got experience in development, penetration test, incident response, <br>security operation planning and investigation. He is a certified as an <br>OSCP, also a SANS GWAPT Holder and published the SANS Gold Paper - "Website <br>Security For Mobile". He is also the VXRL security researcher and CTF crew <br>member.</p><br><h3>Title 2 (3:10-3:30pm):<br/><br>Contemporary Issues in Penetration Testing</h3><br><p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Mr. Timture CHOI, Security Consultant NTT <br>Security</p><br><h4>Abstract</h4><br><p>In recent years, it is not difficult to find hacking events, security <br>incidents, or security breaches etc. on daily news. The introduction of <br>cybersecurity fortification initiative has been set out from Hong Kong <br>Monetary Authority, which purpose is to give out a new testing framework <br>for financial institutes to reduce cyber risks. Intelligence-led cyber <br>attack simulation testing (iCAST) is one of major components as well as a <br>new challenge to these financial institutes. Unlike traditional penetration <br>testing, it merely focuses on individual systems or applications (technical <br>assessment). iCAST is more like an all-in- one suite in which it covers <br>story lines, test goals, and information from cyber threat intelligence. <br>The way to satisfy the requirement from HKMA becomes an important issue to <br>the institutes. In this talk, we are trying to answer this question as a <br>point of view from a pentester.</p><br><h4>Biography</h4><br><p>Timture Choi has mastered several skill sets in information security and <br>education sectors.
